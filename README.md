# PragmaticPassphrase
Single-page web-app for easily generating useful passphrases - using Python with [Anvil](https://anvil.works/).

I built this for work. I was tired of badly designed passphrase generators online, and I wanted this specific feature of easily building a 'pattern' based on tokens and then having the passphrase generated from that... and thus was born this project.

Closed source at this point, planning on posting the code at a later date.
